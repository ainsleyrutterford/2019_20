## Information Processing and the Brain 2019/2020

Here you can find the relevant content for Information Processing and the Brain 2019/2020. This unit covers several aspects of information processing in the brain, such as sensory processing, probabilistic codes, deep learning, recurrent neural networks, credit assignment, reinforcement learning and model-based inference.

It is jointly taught by Conor Houghton, Rui Ponte Costa at the
Department of Computer Science [School of Computer Science, Electrical
and Electronic Engineering, and Engineering Mathematics], Faculty of
Engineering, University of Bristol.
